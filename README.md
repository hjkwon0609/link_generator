# Third Party Application: Link Generator

This is a third party application used to generate links that users can post anywhere (e.g. a Craigslist ad, eBay posting, etc.) that other users can click on. After clicking on the link, our main Chainge server (https://github.com/kev0960/chaingeStanford) will verify the information through our blockchain network. The link generator is currently integrated as a third party extension with our main Chainge project.
